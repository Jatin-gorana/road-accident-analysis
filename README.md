# Road-Accident-Analysis

Project Overview

This project involves analyzing road accident data from the UK over a span of two years (2021-2022). The objective is to extract meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) to understand trends, patterns, and factors contributing to road accidents. The analysis covers various aspects such as casualty severity, types of vehicles involved, and monthly trends.
Key Insights

    Total Casualties: Calculated the total number of casualties over the two-year period, with a breakdown into fatal, serious, and slight casualties.
    Vehicle-Specific Accidents: Analyzed accidents involving different types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, agricultural vehicles, and others.
    Monthly Trends: Identified monthly trends in the number of accidents.
    Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth: Assessed the year-over-year growth of accidents and found a positive impact with a decreasing trend in accidents over the last year.
    Additional Insights: Extracted various other insights related to time of day, weather conditions, road types, and locations.
